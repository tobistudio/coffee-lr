## Demo

You can view a live demo of the project [here](https://barrio.lambdacurry.dev/).


## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   yarn
   ```
3. Test the setup:
   ```
   yarn build
   ```

## Local Development Setup
1. Generate `.env` files for both the Medusa backend and the Remix storefront.
   ```
   yarn run generate-env
   ```
   > This will generate the `apps/medusa/.env` and `apps/storefront/.env` files.

2. Replace the following environment variables in your `apps/medusa/.env` file:
   - `STRIPE_API_KEY` # Your Stripe secret key. Required to checkout.

3. Run the following command to initialize the Medusa database:

   ```
   yarn run medusa:init
   ```

   > This will set up the database and seed it with some initial data, including a user with the email `admin@medusa-test.com` and password `supersecret`.

4. Start the development servers:
   ```
   yarn dev
   ```

   > This will start both the Medusa backend and the Remix storefront in development mode.

5. Create a Publishable API Key for your storefront:

   - Log in to the [Medusa admin](http://localhost:9000/app/login) using the credentials `admin@medusa-test.com` / `supersecret`

   - Navigate to the [_Publishable API Keys_ settings](http://localhost:9000/app/settings/publishable-api-keys) and **copy** an exisiting API Key or create a new one with at least one Sales Channel.

6. Replace the environment variables in the `apps/storefront/.env` file:

   - `MEDUSA_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` # API key from previous step
   - `STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY` # starts with `pk_`
   - `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` # starts with `sk_`

7. Restart your storefront and medusa backend:
      ```
      yarn dev
      ```


## Resetting the Database
In order to reset the database, follow the steps from 3 to 7 in the Local Development Setup section.

## Enabling Express Checkout

> For a more complete guide on how to enable Express Checkout, see the Stripe [documentation](https://docs.stripe.com/elements/express-checkout-element).

To enable Express Checkout in the Medusa Storefront, follow these steps:

1. Enable the payment methods you want to use to during Express Checkout in the Stripe [payment methods settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods).
   - Learn more about Apple Pay integration [here](https://docs.stripe.com/apple-pay) 
   - Learn more about Google Pay integration [here](https://docs.stripe.com/google-pay).

2. Create your own [domain association file](https://docs.stripe.com/apple-pay?platform=web#verify-domain) to verify your domain, and replace the content in the `apps/storefront/app/routes/[.well-known].apple-developer-merchantid-domain-association.tsx` file with your own domain association file content.

3. Register your domain for payment methods - see [this stripe guide](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/pmd-registration) for more information.
   -  for development, you may want to use a service like [ngrok](https://ngrok.com).
   -  for production, a domain with `https` is required.
